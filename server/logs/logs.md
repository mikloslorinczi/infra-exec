## Logs

Whenever the Infra Client executes a task, it creates a logfile in the **taskID.log** format containing the output of the task-command (both stdout & stderr)

Then the client uploads it to the server, and it will be stored in this folder.

With the Infra CLI users can download these logs from the Infra Server
